;; Created by Catherine Enright on 2011-08-31 10:12:13
;; The purpose of this module is to provide an interface for running particle-filtering on a dbn
;;
;; The function run-inference has 4 mandatory parameters and 2 optional ones.
;;       dbn-filename:      The filename (including path) of the dbn specification
;;       evidence-filename: The filename (including path) of the evidence. 
;;                          The first row must contain the nodenames_0 separated by spaces and end with "nil"
;;                          After the first row there should be one row per time step containing the evidence 
;;                          values again separated by spaces. If no evidence exists for a time step use "nil"
;;       output-filename:   The filename (including path) where the output should be sent. Note if the filename 
;;                          already exists it will be overwritten without warning.
;;       no-timestep:       The number of steps for which inference must be performed
;;
;;       no-samples:         Number of samples to use, defaults to 1000
;;
;; Change Log: Version 2: no-samples is now a mandatory parameter and return teh results for all nodes.
;; Change Log: Version 3: Fixed output file so that if a node contains more than 2 discrete states the results are output.
