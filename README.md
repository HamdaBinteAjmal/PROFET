# PROFET
Probabilistic Framework Based on Mathematical Models Toolkit
PROFET is an open source GUI software application that is capable of creating Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) based on mathematical models in form of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The resulting DBN framework can handle both data and model uncertainty in a principled manner, can be used for temporal data mining with noisy and missing data, and can be used to re-estimate model parameters automatically using data streams. PROFET provides implementation of standard fixed time step Particle Filtering and Adaptive-time Particle Filtering algorithms for temporal inference.
