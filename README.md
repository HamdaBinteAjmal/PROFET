# PROFET
PROFET is an open source GUI software application that automatically builds Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN) from Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) entered by the user. The DBN framework generated by PROFET handles both data and model uncertainty in a principled manner. It can be used for temporal data mining with noisy and missing data. It can be used to re-estimate model parameters automatically using data streams. For temporal inference PROFET includes both standard fixed time step Particle Filtering and Adaptive-time Particle Filtering.
